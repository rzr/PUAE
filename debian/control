Description: Unix Amiga Emulator
<<<<<<< HEAD
 This is a fork of E-UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation core
 based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
 to non-Windows platforms. P-UAE was meant to be a Pandora Amiga emulator,
 thus P-UAE, but later become the 'Portable' UAE.
 .
 To make full use of P-UAE you will need access to an image of some version

 of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which
 may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted
